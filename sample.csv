"classic connolly boxed set (vol 1 & 2) [editor's note: the following is a combined review with classic connolly in words and music.]--those of you who enjoyed billy connolly's moving performance in the film mrs. brown may not know (or believe) that he began his professional life as a glasgow folky and gained first fame as a stand-up comic. now's your chance to catch up on his sordid past with these compilations from his club recordings of the '70s and '80s. he loves the shaggy dog story and the wicked song but doesn't mind flinging one-liners either. his raucous, scatological, profane humor is best enjoyed by heavy drinkers familiar with the scottish tongue. the rest of us will get plenty of yuks from those punch lines we can decipher.  y.r.  audiofile 2001, portland, maine--copyright  audiofile, portland, maine",books

"war poems: an anthology of poetry from the 18th cantury to the present day writing poetry has always been a way to express what is going on in the world around us. unfortunately, sometimes what is around us is war. acclaimed british actor paul mcgann reads poems that date from the eighteenth century to modern times in this moving audio anthology. mcgann is originally from liverpool, and he still retains a slight northern accent. its lilting cadence blends well with the rhythm and worldliness of these powerful poems. although some of the pieces are well known, others are less so, and this makes the collection even more intriguing for lovers of literature.  r.a.p.  audiofile 2001, portland, maine--copyright  audiofile, portland, maine",books

"pearl and sir orfeo while many readers are familiar with sir gawain and the green knight (and perhaps even tolkien's translation), these poems from the same fourteenth-century manuscript are less well known. pearl the longer of the two, is an elegy for the poet's baby daughter, told in alliterative verse. sir orfeo is a celtic version of the greek myth of orpheus and eurydice, complete with a happy ending that the older story lacks. terry jones, former member of monty python and a medieval scholar to boot, sounds perfectly comfortable with the rhythms and language. one even gets a taste of the original middle english on the final side, when jones puts these works into context by reading tolkien's own introductions.  d.b.  audiofile 2001, portland, maine--copyright  audiofile, portland, maine",books

"master georgie beryl bainbridge seems drawn to disaster. first she tackled the  unfortunate scott expedition to the south pole inthe birthday boys; later (but emphatically pre-dicaprio) came the sinking of the titanic, inevery man for himself. now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the crimean war, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the light brigade's charge--but, thankfully, without the tennysonian bombast. ""some pictures,"" a character confides, ""would only cause alarm to ordinary folk."" there's a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:master georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.bainbridge's narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of george hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous liverpool life by heading for the crimean peninsula in 1854. his journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her ""master georgie"" becomes an overriding obsession; pompey jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and george's sometime lover; and dr. potter, george's scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the war's carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.united by a sudden death in a liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. in between, bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses ""fractured into a spider's web""; a decapitated leg, toes ""poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot""; two dead men ""on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands."" glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.master georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--mary park--this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",books

"apple a day: the myths, misconceptions and truths about the foods we eat widely known in canada from hismontreal gazettecolumn, and work with the discovery channel, schwarcz (let them eat flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies, advertising claims, special interest groups, age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. in short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. to help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). more importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(jan.)copyright  reed business information, a division of reed elsevier inc. all rights reserved.--this text refers to an alternatehardcoveredition.",books

"the jews in america a glossy, predictable paean to american jewry by the producers of the day in the life series, this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country, capturing cowboys and soviet jewry activists, magicians and roving rabbis. the belabored point here is that jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, passover seder--that set them apart, but jews are also as american as apple pie. hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. cohen, co-editor of christmas in america , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of steven spielberg and his mom, leah adler, who owns a kosher l.a. restaurant, combines the two themes). a picture of the jewish attorneys of a century city law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive.copyright 1989 reed business information, inc.",books

"a day in the life of china ninety photographers (60 western, 30 chinese) fanned out across china on a single day--april 15, 1989--to take the pictures that make up this rare, candid glimpse of the world's most populous nation. the photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. from a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on main street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of mongolian nomads to a tantric buddhist monastery in occupied tibet. the photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at beijing university as students began to occupy tiananmen square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed. first serial to time; author tour.copyright 1989 reed business information, inc.",books

"dirt & deity: a life of robert burns a marginally educated seducer and drunk who died at 37 in 1796 remains scotland's premier poet and songsmith. mcintyre's bicentenary biography (his last was a life of bbc founder john reith, the expense of glory) is unsparing about burns and his uneven output, from haunting lyrics to bawdy songs. carlyle, so mcintyre writes, saw burns's career as ""a tragedy of potential unfulfilled and opportunity squandered."" rather, mcintyre contends, there was scant opportunity in hardscrabble ayrshire in burns's time, and the flavor of that bleak life as it was actually lived is vividly evoked, as are the poet's self-defeating imprudences of every sort. having little schooling, burns pragmatically described his working methods as ""untill i am compleat master of a tune, in my own singing... i can never compose for it."" his practice was not that of the university, but it produced ""flow gently, sweet afton"" and ""the cotter's saturday night."" he also produced more children, illegitimate and legal, than he could afford, and left his plough for a meager salary as excise tax inspector that kept him on horseback and away from home, from the contemplative time for writing and from exploiting usefully his flair for friendship with admiring men and adoring women in circles above his class. his lyrical gift had pushed him out of the milieu that moved him to verse. as mcintyre observes, burns's local literary reputation, once spread, ""had both made and undone him."" he had ""an extraordinary blindness to where his own interest lay."" although he was ""never the slave of time,"" that became another of his many failings. mcintyre's careful scrutiny of burns is exemplified by his quoting an exculpatory letter ostensibly done in haste. ""pardon this confused scrawl,"" burns explains. ""?indeed i know not well what i have written."" but, mcintyre notes, ""that was not strictly true?he had taken time to try his hand at a draft."" illustrated.copyright 1996 reed business information, inc.",books

"a day in the life of canada like the similar books about australia, hawaii, and japan, each of these offers multiple photographic impressions recorded on a single day. canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. the photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. a lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (june 8, 1984). the photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. with more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. the introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. and indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. the heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (may 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images. both recommended for their candid presentation of ordinary daily life. kathleen collins, library of congresscopyright 1985 reed business information, inc.",books

"a day in the life of ireland on one day in may 1991 more than 75 distinguished photographers undertook to capture on film the many sides of ireland and its people. as with previous day in the life explorations of other countries, the photographs provide a stunning panorama of everyday life in a variety of settings, from pastoral to urban, from working-class neighborhoods to country estates. celebrating the land and its citizens, these 200 mainly color photographs are accompanied by maps indicating the location of each and by concise captions. subjects include a benedictine nun on a monastery farm, a man soaking in his bath at a spa, a covey of ""punk rockers"" in a dublin neighborhood, the bishop of cork putting ""a little body irish"" on a road bowling match. a feast for the eyes is the result of an impressively coordinated project that, though ambitious, makes no claim as a definitive record of a complex country. 90,000 first printing; major ad/promo; first serial to islands magazine.copyright 1991 reed business information, inc.",books

"a day in the life of japan on june 7, 1985, 100 photographers from around the world set out to cover japan. many had participated in a day in the life of canada ( lj 11/1/85) and the similar books on australia and hawaii. this, however, is the first such coverage of a non-western, non-english-speaking country. the color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. the pictures are arranged chronologically, from early morning until late at night. a map of japan shows where each was taken. photographers are credited next to their pictures, and biographies of participants follow the picture essay, as does a story about their experiences taking these 300 pictures, chosen from some 135,000 exposures. the range of subjects covered is enormous and shakes up our notions about japan. highly recommended. kathleen collins, library of congresscopyright 1986 reed business information, inc.",books

"harvey penick's little red golf book: lessons and teachings from a lifetime in golf before titanium drivers, before oversized heads and bubble shafts, before electronic systems to tell you how far you are from the pin, golf was much the same game it is today. the lessons harvey penick taught in the pre-gadget days  still stand. the golf swing is basically the same, and penick could teach it better than anybody. for most of his life, he never intended to publish hislittle red book, a notebook of golf wisdom and anecdotes that he  compiled with the idea that he'd pass it on to his son. but, for the sake of history, it's a good thing that he changed his mind. contained in its 175 pages is just about all you need to know about golf from a technical standpoint, along with penick's priceless memories of working with famous pros, teaching absolute nobodies to get the ball in the air, and finding a horde of bat guano and hauling it across town in a pickup truck to fertilize his golf course. this book makes you feel good about playing golf, that you're part of something steeped in ritual and mystery and tradition, and that the game was played perfectly well before perimeter-weighted, graphite-shafted irons came along.--this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",books

"city of djinns: a year in delhi delhi has a richly layered past, and dalrymple (in xanadu, mckay, 1990) deftly peels away each layer to reveal how the city came to be what it is today. djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. the author, a young scot carrying on the fine british tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. he introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. his wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text. considering the importance of delhi, the capital of the world's second most populous nation, this book deserves to be in most public and academic libraries.harold m. otness, southern oregon state coll. lib., ashlandcopyright 1994 reed business information, inc.",books

"getting used to dying few american novels can approach the power and impact of this extraordinary work, a fictionalized autobiography by the chinese author of half of man is woman . a harrowing account of the effects of repressive government on the individual, the novel moves between china and san francisco, new york and paris as its protagonist examines his own ""old-fashioned patriotism"" during a trip to the west. central to the character's psyche are the wounds left by his attempted ""reformation"" by the communists, a process which at one point involves his being marched to the execution ground--and left alive while those around him are killed, to wait for the rest of his life for the bullet to find him. the scene on the execution ground is unforgettable, its shocking subject filtered through a careful and farseeing irony. although the level of the writing is generally sophisticated, the prose is occasionally self-conscious or strained--but this failing in no way impinges on the book's greatest accomplishment, its inherent refutation of its own dire assessment of china today: ""a country that cannot produce a nobility of the spirit is a country that is doomed.""copyright 1990 reed business information, inc.--this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",books

"red wolf, red wolf dense with meaning, engagingly readable and with a universal truth at their core, these stories have the impact of well-wrought poetry. as in his novel shoeless joe , in which a long-deceased baseball player sets up a game in a startled fan's backyard, kinsella's title piece explores the shifting borders of reality as flannery o'connor's character enoch emery comes to life and moves in with his creator. the stories' themes and characters are often fanciful, sometimes verging on the bizarre--the survivor of a freakish crime, as in ""oh, marley,"" or a man who runs off with his daughter's teenage friend in ""evangeline's mother""--but in kinsella's hands they become poignantly credible. profiling a wife's long-buried resentments as reflected in her ""driving patterns,"" the author expertly sets a menacing mood. narrated by the gunfighter's mild-mannered friend, ""billy in trinidad"" shows a sympathetic side of billy the kid. a disaffected baseball player finds true love in ""butterfly winter,"" a tale that evokes the magical realism of south american fiction, while a yuppie ruefully recalls his carefree '60s days and his hippie girlfriend in the endpiece, ""mother tucker's yellow duck.""copyright 1990 reed business information, inc.--this text refers to thepaperbackedition.",books
